# Mentor Mind - Comprehensive Logging Guide

## Overview

The Mentor Mind backend now includes a robust logging system that tracks the entire flow of learning path generation, helping you debug and understand where responses come from (AI vs fallback sources).

## Log Files Structure

### Log Files Location
All logs are stored in the `backend/logs/` directory:

```
backend/logs/
├── mentor_mind_YYYYMMDD.log     # All application logs (DEBUG level)
└── mentor_mind_errors_YYYYMMDD.log   # Error-only logs (ERROR level)
```

### Log File Types

1. **Daily Application Log** (`mentor_mind_YYYYMMDD.log`)
   - Contains ALL log entries from DEBUG to ERROR levels
   - Detailed function calls, line numbers, and full flow tracking
   - Best for understanding the complete application flow

2. **Error Log** (`mentor_mind_errors_YYYYMMDD.log`)
   - Contains only ERROR level logs
   - Perfect for quick error identification
   - Includes stack traces and detailed error context

## Log Format

```
TIMESTAMP | LEVEL | LOGGER_NAME | FUNCTION_NAME | LINE:NUMBER | MESSAGE
```

Example:
```
2024-01-15 14:30:25 | INFO     | main                 | generate_learning_path | LINE:125  | 🎯 LEARNING PATH GENERATION REQUEST
2024-01-15 14:30:25 | INFO     | main                 | generate_learning_path | LINE:127  |    Request ID: a1b2c3d4
```

## Key Flow Tracking

### 1. Request Lifecycle Tracking

Every HTTP request gets a unique ID and is tracked from start to finish:

```
📥 INCOMING REQUEST [ID: a1b2c3d4]
   Method: POST
   URL: http://localhost:8000/generate-learning-path
   Client: 127.0.0.1
   
🎯 LEARNING PATH GENERATION REQUEST
   Request ID: a1b2c3d4
   Topic: 'React'
   
📤 RESPONSE [ID: a1b2c3d4]
   Status: 200
   Processing Time: 2.456s
   Total Resources: 25
```

### 2. Response Source Identification

The logging system clearly identifies where responses come from:

#### 🤖 AI-Generated Responses (DeepSeek/OpenRouter)
```
✅ AI CURATION SUCCESSFUL
   Total AI resources: 25
   🤖 RESPONSE SOURCE: AI TUTOR (DeepSeek/OpenRouter API)
   🤖 CONFIRMED SOURCE: AI TUTOR (DeepSeek via OpenRouter)
```

#### 📋 Manual Curation Responses
```
✅ MANUAL CURATION MATCH FOUND
   Matched template: 'react'
   📋 RESPONSE SOURCE: MANUAL CURATION (Manual fallback due to AI failures)
```

#### 🔄 Basic Fallback Responses
```
🆘 BASIC FALLBACK: Generating emergency resources
   🔄 RESPONSE SOURCE: BASIC FALLBACK (Emergency fallback)
```

### 3. Complete Learning Path Generation Flow

The system logs a step-by-step breakdown:

```
🎯 STARTING LEARNING PATH GENERATION
📝 STEP 1: Topic validation and cleaning
🤖 STEP 2: Requesting curated resources from Expert AI Tutor
🔍 STEP 3: Processing and validating resources
✂️ STEP 4: Creating final learning path (limiting to top 5 per category)
✅ LEARNING PATH GENERATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
```

## How to Debug Common Issues

### 1. AI API Problems

Look for these patterns in logs:

```bash
# Check if AI calls are being made
grep "🤖 ATTEMPTING AI-POWERED CURATION" logs/mentor_mind_*.log

# Check AI failures
grep "❌ AI CURATION FAILED" logs/mentor_mind_*.log

# Check rate limiting
grep "⏱️ RATE LIMITING" logs/mentor_mind_*.log

# Check API timeouts
grep "⏰ AI API TIMEOUT" logs/mentor_mind_*.log
```

### 2. Response Source Tracking

```bash
# Find all AI-generated responses
grep "🤖 RESPONSE SOURCE: AI TUTOR" logs/mentor_mind_*.log

# Find all manual curation responses
grep "📋 RESPONSE SOURCE: MANUAL CURATION" logs/mentor_mind_*.log

# Find all fallback responses
grep "🔄 RESPONSE SOURCE: BASIC FALLBACK" logs/mentor_mind_*.log
```

### 3. Performance Analysis

```bash
# Check processing times
grep "Processing Time:" logs/mentor_mind_*.log

# Check resource counts
grep "Total Resources:" logs/mentor_mind_*.log

# Check API response times
grep "API Response received in" logs/mentor_mind_*.log
```

### 4. Error Investigation

```bash
# Check all errors
grep "💥" logs/mentor_mind_*.log

# Check warnings
grep "⚠️" logs/mentor_mind_*.log

# Check specific component errors
grep "EXPERT AI TUTOR ERROR" logs/mentor_mind_*.log
```

## Real-Time Monitoring

### Console Output
The application shows important logs in the console with timestamps and concise messages:

```
14:30:25 | INFO  | main           | 🎯 LEARNING PATH GENERATION REQUEST
14:30:25 | INFO  | services.expert_ai_tutor | 🤖 ATTEMPTING AI-POWERED CURATION
14:30:27 | INFO  | services.expert_ai_tutor | ✅ AI CURATION SUCCESSFUL
```

### Log Levels by Component

- **main**: Request/response lifecycle, high-level flow
- **services.learning_path_generator**: Learning path creation and coordination
- **services.expert_ai_tutor**: AI API calls and responses
- **services.resource_curator**: Manual curation and fallbacks
- **services.ai_response_parser**: AI response parsing and validation

## Debugging Workflow

### 1. Quick Health Check
```bash
# Check if server started properly
grep "🚀 MENTOR MIND APPLICATION STARTUP" logs/mentor_mind_*.log

# Check configuration
grep "🔧 API Configuration" logs/mentor_mind_*.log
```

### 2. Request Investigation
```bash
# Find a specific request by topic
grep -A 20 "Topic: 'YOUR_TOPIC'" logs/mentor_mind_*.log

# Follow a request by ID
grep "ID: a1b2c3d4" logs/mentor_mind_*.log
```

### 3. Source Analysis
```bash
# Count response sources for today
grep -c "🤖 RESPONSE SOURCE: AI TUTOR" logs/mentor_mind_$(date +%Y%m%d).log
grep -c "📋 RESPONSE SOURCE: MANUAL CURATION" logs/mentor_mind_$(date +%Y%m%d).log
grep -c "🔄 RESPONSE SOURCE: BASIC FALLBACK" logs/mentor_mind_$(date +%Y%m%d).log
```

```bash
# Average processing time analysis
grep "Processing Time:" logs/mentor_mind_*.log | awk '{print $NF}' | sed 's/s//' | awk '{sum+=$1; count++} END {print "Average:", sum/count "s"}'

# AI vs Fallback usage ratio
ai_count=$(grep -c "🤖 RESPONSE SOURCE: AI TUTOR" logs/mentor_mind_*.log)
fallback_count=$(grep -c "📋 RESPONSE SOURCE: MANUAL CURATION\|🔄 RESPONSE SOURCE: BASIC FALLBACK" logs/mentor_mind_*.log)
echo "AI: $ai_count, Fallback: $fallback_count"
```

### Error Pattern Analysis
```bash
# Most common errors
grep "💥" logs/mentor_mind_*.log | cut -d'|' -f6 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

# AI failure patterns
grep -A 5 "❌ AI CURATION FAILED" logs/mentor_mind_*.log
```
